## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{We decided to choose this topic because we are both from two different countries and we were interested in learning about the average life expectancy in 15 major countries over 217 years. We felt this topic would be thought-provoking as it is an uncommon subject people talk about. It's a subject that people will think about but not enough to do great research on it. Knowing the average life expectancy of countries over 217 years gives information on the quality of life and how it has changed over the years. Life expectancy data will help to identify problems within the public health, and with that information, they can improve on it. The data provided will be an aid to indicate and compare generations and analyze trends. Through this topic, we can learn the level of development of a country's welfare state. We think this topic is important as it describes population conditions of major countries.}

{The dataset contains 15 different countries, such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India etc. The dataset ranges from the 1800s to 2016. There are over 9762 observations. There are significant life expectancy age differences over the years for every country. The ages vary in large numbers and the avergage life expectancy age increases over the years. In Mexico, the average life expectancy was 27 in 1800 and it has increased to the age of 76 by 2016. The dataset proves that the quality of life has improved pronouncely over the years. Each country has different life expectancy ages, but all countries enhanced their motality rate. Key information are provided to indicate characteristics and the welfare of a country. Considerable materials are provided for us to use this dataset succesfully.  }
